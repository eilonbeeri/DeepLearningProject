# Deepfake Detection using Vision Transformers (ViT)
Trained on FaceForensics++, this project applies preprocessing and data augmentation to extract face crops, then trains a Vision Transformer with adaptive optimization, mixed precision, early stopping, and EMA. Achieves high accuracy and robust deepfake detection on test videos.
